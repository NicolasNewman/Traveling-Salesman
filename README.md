# üìã Intro

The _Wandering Merchant of Arkesia_ is a Discord bot that runs alongside [Saint Bot](https://saint-bot.webflow.io/). It enables reading from subcribed channels from Saint Bot's official server and pinging users on your own server once a certain item is in stock. Furthermore, the bot can text users when an item of their preference is in stock. Never miss a Wei card again!

# üöß Setup

1. Invite the bot to your server
2. Run `/setup-channels` to configure which channel contains the Saint Bot updates and which channel the bot should send pings
3. Run `/setup-roles` to automatically create the roles that the bot pings
4. [Optional] Run `/setup-reactions` to create a message that users can react to too assign roles automatically
5. [Optional] Run `/status` to ensure there are no missing configuration settings
6. Enjoy!

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Hosting

Due to limited resources, I won't be providing a server to host the bot for the public. If you'd like to add the bot to your server, you'll either need to host it yourself or find someone else who is hosting it for the public. If you choose to host it yourself, the instructions are as follows:

## Prerequisites

The following tools are needed to run the bot:

- [NodeJS v16.6+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Postgres SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

1. Clone the bot's repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/NicolasNewman/Traveling-Salesman.git`
